  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>My education and interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical sciences. 
I like my work to deliver real world benefits. I believe that success in tech is a combo of two main things: understanding how to balance developing novel cutting edge solutions vs pragmatic hacking, and great teams who care about each other.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I love playing with simulations, mostly related to artificial life and biology, and analysing and visualising their multi-scale dynamics and emergent properties.</p>

<h1 id="current-work">Current work</h1>
<p>I currently work as Staff Neuromorphic Engineer &amp; Program Manager at a Dutch start-up Innatera Nanosystems. 
I help to combine data science, digital signal processing, TinyML and a cutting edge mixed-signal hardware into applications enabling efficient AI for sensors.</p>

<p>I am also a Honorary Lecturer at University College London, and a part of the teaching team for the Cognitive Systems and Intelligent Technologies module.</p>

<h1 id="phd-in-artificial-intelligence">PhD in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>I did my PhD in bio-inspired AI: spiking neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. 
As a part of my PhD, I have completed SysMIC (Systems training in Maths, Informatics and Computational Biology) and Bio-business courses.
I also worked as a teaching assistant for the following UCL courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning for Domain Specialists,</li>
  <li>Cognitive Systems and Intelligent Technologies,</li>
  <li>Robotics Programming,</li>
  <li>Principles of Programming in C.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="biomedical-sciences">Biomedical Sciences</h1>
<p>I have a solid background in life sciences (BSc, MSc and professional) and hands-on experience in molecular and developmental neuroscience, pharmacology, drug delivery and stem cell research.</p>

<p>I was a doctoral advisor to the UCL international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition team in 2016 (gold medal).</p>

<h1 id="artificial-life">Artificial Life</h1>
<p>Artificial Life (ALife) research and community has a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>I was a Program Committee member for the 2022 and 2023 Conference on Artificial Life, and a co-organiser of the 2020 workshop on the Agent-Based Modelling of Human Behaviour.</p>

<p>I was a board member of the Emergent Researchers in Alife society (a student and postdoc group group affiliated with The International Society for Artificial Life) in 2019 and 2020.</p>
