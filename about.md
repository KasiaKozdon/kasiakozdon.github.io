My education and interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical sciences. 
I like my work to deliver real world benefits. I believe that success in tech is a combo of two main things: understanding how to balance developing novel cutting edge solutions vs pragmatic hacking, and great teams who care about each other.

In my spare time, I love playing with simulations, mostly related to artificial life and biology, and analysing and visualising their multi-scale dynamics and emergent properties.

# Current work
I currently work as Staff Neuromorphic Engineer & Program Manager at a Dutch start-up Innatera Nanosystems. 
I help to combine data science, digital signal processing, TinyML and a cutting edge mixed-signal hardware into applications enabling efficient AI for sensors.  

I am also a Honorary Lecturer at University College London, and a part of the teaching team for the Cognitive Systems and Intelligent Technologies module. 

# PhD in Artificial Intelligence
I did my PhD in bio-inspired AI: spiking neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. 
As a part of my PhD, I have completed SysMIC (Systems training in Maths, Informatics and Computational Biology) and Bio-business courses.
I also worked as a teaching assistant for the following UCL courses: 
* Machine Learning for Domain Specialists,
* Cognitive Systems and Intelligent Technologies,
* Robotics Programming,
* Principles of Programming in C.

# Biomedical Sciences
I have a solid background in life sciences (BSc, MSc and professional) and hands-on experience in molecular and developmental neuroscience, pharmacology, drug delivery and stem cell research. 

I was a doctoral advisor to the UCL international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition team in 2016 (gold medal). 

# Artificial Life
Artificial Life (ALife) research and community has a special place in my heart.

I was a Program Committee member for the 2022 and 2023 Conference on Artificial Life, and a co-organiser of the 2020 workshop on the Agent-Based Modelling of Human Behaviour. 

I was a board member of the Emergent Researchers in Alife society (a student and postdoc group group affiliated with The International Society for Artificial Life) in 2019 and 2020.
